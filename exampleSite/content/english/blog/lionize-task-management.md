Nowadays there are so many task management applications and websites that our tasks are spread around all over the internet. 

What if we had a task aggregator which can aggregate from different sources and show in different views.

So we did just that, started to develop a task aggregator.

The initial version will have only one view: [The Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/).

Later we will add other views like Calendar view, Kanban view, Scrum view, and so on.

Hope you will like it.

Code is open source and can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/lionize).
